# Fabric vs. Warp (React components)

This project aims to compare Fabric and Warp, in order to assess their coexistence and ensure that the design and functionality remain consistent. By running this project, you can test and evaluate how these two design systems work together. The goal is that the components look identical, regardless of the order of the stylesheet imports.

## Change the order of stylesheet imports

## Modify Warp brand css

To observe the warp components with a different theme, change theme in `index.html`.
